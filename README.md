# Typescript React Template

A Typescript React template I created mostly for myself. Includes Vite, ESLint, and Prettier all configured (and hopefully I didn't make any mistakes). To get started, run `npm install`.

Additionally, make sure you have the ESLint and Prettier extensions (VSCode) all set up and ready to go.
